Using easyOCR and [MarianMT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/marian) from Hugging Face with help from Github Copilot and ChatGPT, I created a python workflow where I can upload an image, define its path, run OCR, translate to Spanish, and print a PDF containing the image, text-recognition, and translation.

The image I used is from the Triceratops fosil model on display at SEEC, which I found more interesting that the CU Boulder Art Museum exhibits while they are partially closed.
